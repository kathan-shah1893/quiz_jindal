You are given a set of option-wise justifications for multiple-choice questions. Your task is to combine these individual justifications into a single, well-written paragraph. The paragraph should:

* Clearly explain each option’s correctness or incorrectness.
* Use proper English grammar and punctuation.
* Separate each option’s explanation with a `<br>` HTML tag at the start to ensure clarity when displayed on a webpage.
* Maintain the original intent and meaning of each justification.

**Example Input:**

```json
{
  "option1": "False – Leaving them on the desk makes them accessible to unauthorized individuals.",
  "option2": "Correct – Locked cabinets restrict access and protect sensitive information.",
  "option3": "False – Hiding is not a secure or reliable method.",
  "option4": "False – Unlocked drawers can be easily accessed by others."
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```html
<br>Option 1 is false because leaving sensitive documents on the desk makes them accessible to unauthorized individuals.  
<br>Option 2 is correct since locked cabinets restrict access and help protect sensitive information.  
<br>Option 3 is false because hiding documents is neither a secure nor a reliable method of protection.  
<br>Option 4 is false as unlocked drawers can be easily accessed by others, compromising security.
```
